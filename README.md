## Time Series Anomaly Detection for IoT Sensors

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end anomaly detection system
for multivariate IoT sensor time-series data to identify abnormal
equipment behavior.

## Approach
- Synthetic time-series data generation with injected anomalies
- Feature engineering using rolling statistics
- Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection
- Autoencoder neural network for deep learning-based detection
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. Required libraries:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn
   - tensorflow

 ## Output
- Time-series visualizations
- Detected anomalies highlighted
- Model performance comparison
